R, or RStudio is a statistical software programming package that allows the user to carry out different types of statistical analysis. It can also be used as a GIS software to perform various kinds of spatial analysis programmatically, as opposed to the traditional point-and-click routines in ArcGIS or QGIS, which you will see in the workshop. In the same vein, you can use it for data managing and geo-processing (i.e., importing different types of spatial formats for manipulation beforehand for spatial analysis). There are two versions of the software: The famous icon on the left is the version for R, and the one on the right is the version for RStudio. Both software packages are the same. The only difference is that RStudio is attractive, intuitive, and more importantly, it is user-friendly than Base R. So, we will be using this version (i.e., RStudio) throughout the course. Let us talk about downloading RStudio. 1.2 Downloading and install R and RStudio on to your laptop RStudio is an open source software, and today its the go-to software for many researchers or data scientists - its highly recommended for anyone in the domains of data science, statistics, scientific research, and technical communication. It is easy to access, and easy to download and install. In order for RStudio to work you must first install R. You can follow the steps to download and install the correct version of R and RStudio for your operating system (i.e., Windows or MAC). 1.2.1 Installation for MacOS users You will need to have the following software installed for R and RStudio to work properly on MAC.

Double-click the downloaded file (i.e., RStudio-2023.06.2-561.dmg) and then drag and drop the RStudio icon into the Applications folder to complete the installation. Installation of XQuartz (2.8.5): Some functions in R require some of the libraries from XQuartz to function properly on your MAC. You can download the latest version of XQuartz (XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg) by clicking on this LINK. You can simply complete the installation process by following its steps. Installation of XCode (14.3.1 [14E300c]): Some functions in R require some of the external developer tools from XCode application to function properly on your MAC. Go to the App Store application and get the XCode app downloaded by clicking on this LINK. Once it is downloaded, you can click on the “OPEN” button to verify it’s been downloaded. A window will prompt you to complete installation. Lastly, and for safe measures - we going to run this through our Terminal. You can open the Terminal program by going to the Applications &gt; Utilities folder and select the Terminal application In the terminal, type the following code xcode-select --install. If you get the following error message shown in the code chunk below, then it means that the XCode program has been installed properly - no need to do anything at this point. Otherwise, the terminal will proceed to install the XCode tool remotely. xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use &quot;Software Update&quot; in System Settings to install updates This completes the installation process for R and RStudio on MAC. 1.2.2 Installation for Windows users You will need to have the following software installed for the rstan package to work on Windows. R (version 4.2.3) Rtools42 (version 4.2) RStudio (version 2023.06.0-421) Installation of R (4.3.2) and RStudio RStudio (2023.06.2-561) on Windows: OS User type R (Base) RStudio Desktop Windows R-4.2.3-win.exe RStudio-2023.06.2-561.exe Download the file for R-4.2.3-win.exe attached in the table above.

"],["introduction-to-rstudio-and-geoprocessing.html", "2 Introduction to RStudio and Geoprocessing 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Basics of managing data in RStudio 2.3 Basic visualisation of spatial data in RStudio", " 2 Introduction to RStudio and Geoprocessing 2.1 Introduction The goal for session is to get you started with using RStudio, and being familiar with its environment. The session aims to introduce you to the basic programming etiquette, as well as building confidence for using RStudio as a GIS tool. At the end of this session, you should be able to perform some basic data managing tasks as well as generate choropleths in RStudio. 2.1.1 Learning outcomes The first task includes getting you started with RStudio by installing the needed software(s) (i.e., RStudio and R) on to your personal laptop, and becoming familiar with its environment and panels. We will begin a soft introduction on the basics of managing data in RStudio. This includes learning how to create various objects in RStudio such as vector and data frame objects. The crucial part of this session we be to know how to the set working directories as well as import your dataset in RStudio. Finally, we will learn how to perform the basic visualisation of spatial data in RStudio. Let us begin. 2.1.2 Becoming familiar with the panels in RStudio You should by now have opened RStudio on your laptop. When opening RStudio for the first time, you are greeted with its interface. The window is split into three panels: 1.) R Console, 2.) Environments and 3.) Files, help &amp; Output. Panel 1: The Console lets the user type in R-codes to perform quick commands and basic calculations. Panel 2: The Environments lets the user see which datasets, spatial objects and other files are currently stored in RStudio’s memory Panel 3: Under the File tab, it lets the user access other folders stored in the computer to open datasets. Under the Help tab, it also allows the user to view the help menu for codes and commands. Finally, under the Plots tab, the user can perusal his/her generated plots (e.g., histogram, scatterplot, maps etc.). The above section is the Menu Bar. You can access other functions for saving, editing, and opening a new Script File for writing codes. Opening a new Script File will reveal a fourth panel above the Console. You can open a Script File by: Clicking on the File tab listed inside the Menu Bar. A scroll down bar will reveal itself. Here, you can scroll to the section that says New File. Under New File, click on R Script. This should open a new Script File titled “Untitled 1”. Important Notes: Throughout the course, and in all practical tutorials, you will be encouraged to use an R Script for collating and saving the codes you have written for carrying out spatial analysis. However, we will start writing codes in a script later when we reach to section 1.3 of this tutorial. For now, let us start with the absolute basics, which is interacting with the R Console and using it as a basic calculator for typing simple code. 2.1.3 Using R Console as a Calculator The R console window (i.e., Panel 1) is the place where RStudio is waiting for you to tell it what to do. It will show the code you have commanded RStudio to execute, and it will also show the results from that command. You can type the commands directly into the window for execution as well. Let us start by using the console window as a basic calculator for typing in addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponents (^) and performing other complex sums. Click inside the R Console window and type 19+8, and press enter key button ↵ to get your answer. Quickly perform the following maths by typing them inside the R Console window: # Perform addition 19+8 # Perform subtraction 20-89 # Perform multiplication 18*20 # Perform division 27/3 # To number to a power e.g., 2 raise to the power of 8 2^8 # Perform complex sums (5*(170-3.405)/91)+1002 Aside from basic arithmetic operations, we can use some basic mathematical functions such as the exponential and logarithms: exp() is the exponential function log() is the logarithmic function Do not worry at all about these functions as you will use them later in the weeks to come for transforming variables. Perform the following by typing them inside the R Console window: # use exp() to apply an exponential to a value exp(5) # use log() to transforrm a value on to a logarithm scale log(3) 2.1.4 Creating basic objects and assigning values to it Now that we are familiar with using the console as a calculator. Let us build from this and learn one of the most important codes in RStudio which is called the Assignment Operator. This arrow symbol &lt;- is called the Assignment Operator. It is typed by pressing the less than symbol key &lt; followed by the hyphen symbol key -. It allows the user to assign values to an Object in R. Objects are defined as stored quantities in RStudio’s environment. These objects can be assigned anything from numeric values to character string values. For instance, say we want to create a numeric object called x and assign it with a value of 3. We do this by typing x &lt;- 3. When you enter the object x in the console and press enter ↵, it will return the numeric value 3. Another example, suppose we want to create a string object called y and assign it with some text \"Hello!\". We do this typing y &lt;- \"Hello!\". When you enter y in console, it will return the text value Hello. Let us create the objects a,b, c, and d and assign them with numeric values. Perform the following by typing them inside the R Console window: # Create an object called &#39;a&#39; and assign the value 17 to it a &lt;- 17 # Type the object &#39;a&#39; in console as a command to return value 17 a # Create an object called &#39;b&#39; and assign the value 10 to it b &lt;- 10 # Type the object &#39;b&#39; in console as a command to return value 10 b # Create an object called &#39;c&#39; and assign the value 9 to it c &lt;- 9 # Type the object &#39;c&#39; in console as a command to return value 9 c # Create an object called &#39;d&#39; and assign the value 8 to it d &lt;- 8 # Type the object &#39;d&#39; in console as a command to return value 8 d Notice how the objects a, b, c and d and its value are stored in RStudio’s environment panel. We can perform the following arithmetic operations with these object values: # type the following and return an answer (a + b + c + d)/5 # type the following and return an answer (5*(a-c)/d)^2 Let us create more objects but this time we will assign character string(s) to them. Please note that when typing a string of characters as data you will need to cover them with quotation marks \"...\". For example, say we want to create a string object called y and assign it with some text \"Hello!\". We do this by typing y &lt;- \"Hello!\". Try these examples of assigning the following character text to an object: # Create an object called &#39;e&#39; and assign the character string &quot;RStudio&quot; e &lt;- &quot;RStudio&quot; # Type the object &#39;e&#39; in the console as a command to return &quot;RStudio&quot; e # Create an object called &#39;f&#39;, assign character string &quot;Hello world&quot; f &lt;- &quot;Hello world&quot; # Type the object &#39;f&#39; in the console as a command to return &quot;Hello world&quot; f # Create an object called &#39;g&#39; and assign &quot;Blade Runner is amazing&quot; g &lt;- &quot;Blade Runner is amazing&quot; # Type the object &#39;g&#39; in the console to return the result g We are now familiar with using the console and assigning values (i.e., numeric and string values) to objects. The parts covered here are the initial steps and building blocks for coding and creating datasets in RStudio. Let us progress to section 1.3. Here is where the serious stuff start. We will learn the basics of managing data and some coding etiquette - this includes creating data frames, importing &amp; exporting spreadsheets, setting up work directories, column manipulations and merging two data frames. Learning these basic tasks are key for managing data in RStudio. Point of no return: From here on out - let us open a script file and type codes there instead of the Console. We are getting serious now, we will never use the Console again. 2.2 Basics of managing data in RStudio 2.2.1 How do we enter data into RStudio? As you have already seen, RStudio is an object-oriented software package and so entering data is slightly different for the usual way of inputting information into a spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel). Here, you will need to enter the information as a Vector object before combining them into a Data Frame object. Consider this crude example of data containing the additional health information for 4 people. It contains the variable (or column) names ‘id’, ‘name’, ‘height’, ‘weight’ and ‘gender’ id name height weight gender 1 Kofi 1.65 64.2 M 2 Agyekum 1.77 80.3 M 3 Amma 1.70 58.7 F 4 Hawaa’u 1.68 75.0 F Now, when entering data to RStudio it is not like Microsoft Excel where we enter data into the cells of a spreadsheet. In RStudio, data is entered as a sequence of elements and listed inside an object called a vector. For instance, if we have three age values of 12, 57 and 26 years, and we want to enter this in RStudio, we need to use the combine function c() and combine these three elements into a vector object. Hence, the code will be c(12, 57, 26). We can assign this data by typing this code as age &lt;- c(12, 57, 26). Any time you type ‘age’ into RStudio console it will hence return these three values unless you chose to overwrite it with different information. Let us look at this more closely with the 'id' variable in the above data. Each person has an ID number from 1 to 4. We are going to list the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 as a sequence of elements into a vector using the combine function c() and then assign it to as a vector object calling it 'id'. # Create &#39;id&#39; vector object id &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) # Type the vector object &#39;id&#39; in console to see output id Now, let us enter the information the same way for the remaining columns for ‘name’, ‘height’, ‘weight’ and ‘gender’ like we did for ‘id’: # Create &#39;name&#39; vector object name &lt;- c(&quot;Kofi&quot;, &quot;Agyekum&quot;, &quot;Amma&quot;, &quot;Hawaa&#39;u&quot;) # Create &#39;height&#39; (in meters) vector object height &lt;- c(1.65, 1.77, 1.70, 1.68) # Create &#39;weight&#39; (in kg) vector object weight &lt;- c(64.2, 80.3, 58.7, 75.0) # Create &#39;gender&#39; vector object gender &lt;- c(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) Now, that we have the vector objects ready. Let us bring them together to create a proper dataset. This new object is called a Data frame. We need to list the vectors inside the data.frame() function. # Create a dataset (data frame) dataset &lt;- data.frame(id, name, height, weight, gender) # Type the data frame object &#39;dataset&#39; in console to see output dataset # You can also see dataset in a data viewer, type View() to data: View(dataset) Important Notes: The column ‘id’ is a numeric variable with integers. The second column ‘name’ is a text variable with strings. The third &amp; fourth columns ‘height’ and ‘weight’ are examples of numeric variables with real numbers with continuous measures. The variable ‘gender’ is a text variable with strings – however, this type of variable is classed as a categorical variable as individuals were categorised as either ‘M’ and ‘F’. 2.2.2 How do we create a variable based on other existing variables in our data frame? To access a variable by its name within a data frame, you will need to first type the name of the data frame followed by a $ (dollar sign), and then typing the variable’s name of interest. For instance, suppose you just want to see the height values in the Console viewer - you just type: # to access height - you need to type &#39;dataset$height&#39; dataset$height We can use other columns or variables within our data frame to create another variable. This technique is essentially important when cleaning and managing data. From this dataset, it is possible to derive the body mass index bmi from height and weight using the formula: \\(BMI = weight/height^2\\) To generate bmi into our data frame, we would need to access the height (m) and weight (kg) columns using the $ from the data frame its stored to, and apply the above formula as a code to generate the new bmi column: # Create &#39;bmi&#39; in the data frame i.e.,&#39;dataset&#39; and calculate &#39;bmi&#39; # using the $weight and $height dataset$bmi &lt;- dataset$weight/((dataset$height)^2) # View the data frame ‘dataset’ and you will see the new bmi variable inside View(dataset) You can overwrite the height (m) column to change its units into centimeters by multiplying it to 100; equally, the weight (kg) column can be overwritten and converted from units of kilograms to grams by multiplying it to 1000. # using $height and *100 dataset$height &lt;- dataset$height*100 # using $weight and *100 dataset$weight &lt;- dataset$weight*1000 # use View() the data frame ‘dataset’ and you will see the updated variables View(dataset) 2.2.3 How do we set the working directory in our computer by connecting our folder to RStudio with the setwd() function? Now, we are getting very serious here! Important action: Before we do anything - make sure to have downloaded the data set for Day 1 if you haven’t done so by clicking here. In your computer, create a new folder on your desktop page and rename the folder to “Workshop”, and create another folder within the “Workshop” folder rename it as “Day 1”. Make sure to unzip and transfer ALL the downloaded data directly to the Day 1 folder. Now, this part of the session is probably the most important section of this tutorials. It’s usually the “make” or “break” phase (i.e., you ending up loving RStudio OR you hating it and not ever wanting to pick up R again). We are going to learn how to set-up a working directory. This basically refers to us connecting the RStudio software to the folder containing our dataset. It allows the user to tell RStudio to open the data directly from a folder once it knows the path location. The path location specifies the whereabouts of the data file(s) stored within a computer. Setting your directory in RStudio beforehand makes life incredibly easier in terms of finding, importing, exporting and saving data in and out of RStudio. To illustrate what a path location is – suppose on my desktop (mac/widows) there is a folder called “Workshop”, and within that folder, exists another folder called “Day 1”. Finally, suppose a comma separated value (.csv) (CSV) data file called “Ghana_Highrisk_Flood_Surface_Area.csv” is store in this last folder i.e., Day 1. If via RStudio you want to open this CSV data file located in within the “Day 1” folder. You will need to first set the path location to “Day 1” in RStudio using the setwd() function. Therefore, the path location to this folder on a Windows machine would be written as follows, \"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/Workshop/Day 1\". You can access this piece of information simply by: Open the Workshop folder to reveal the Day 1 folder. Open the Day 1 folder in the data files are stored. Now, click on the bar at the top which shows Workshop &gt; Day 1. This should highlight and show \"C:\\Users\\accountName\\Desktop\\Workshop\\Day 1\" Now, copy \"C:\\Users\\accountName\\Desktop\\Workshop\\Day 1\" and paste the path name into the setwd() function in your R script. Lastly, change all the back slashes \\ in the path name to forward slashes / and run the code. It should look like this: setwd(\"C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/Workshop/Day 1\"). For Windows, the setwd() is as follows: # set work directory in windows setwd(&quot;C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/Workshop/Day 1&quot;) For MAC users, its marginally different. The path location would be written as follows, \"/Users/accountName/Desktop/Workshop/Day 1\". You can access this piece of information simply by: Right-clicking on the folder “Day 1” (not file) in which the files are stored. Hold the “Option” ⌥ key down Click Copy \"filename\" as Pathname Paste the copied path name into the function setwd() and run the code For Mac, the setwd() is as follows: # set work directory in macs setwd(&quot;/Users/accountName/Desktop/Workshop/Day 1&quot;) This should set the working directory. Now, let us learn how to import a CSV data into RStudio. 2.2.4 How do we import, merge and export CSV data with RStudio? 2.2.4.1 Importing data using read.csv() As you will be working mostly with comma separated value formatted data (i.e., csv) we will therefore learn how to import and export this type of data format in RStudio. There are two files that we are going to import into RStudio from the folder in Day 1: Ghana_Highrisk_Flood_Surface_Area.csv which contains information on the estimated land surface area in districts defined to be at high risk of flooding in Ghana in 2021. The column NAME_2 represents the names of each district in Ghana. The column FLOOD_PRONE is the estimated surface area (pixel per 100m) affected by floods in each Ghanaian district. Ghana_Total_Land_Surface_Area.csv which contains information on the total land surface area in a district in Ghana. Note that the column NAME_2 represents the names of each district in Ghana, while SURFACE_AREA is the total surface area for the each district (pixel per 100m). To import a csv into RStudio, we use the read.csv() function. To demonstrate this, let us import the high risk flood information into an data frame object and name it as Floodrisk_data # Import data using read.csv() function Floodrisk_data &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;Ghana_Highrisk_Flood_Surface_Area.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;) Just in case…suppose if we did NOT set the working directory earlier. We would have to go through the hassle of typing the path location in the read.csv(). For windows: Floodrisk_data &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;C:/Users/accountName/Desktop/Workshop/Day 1/Ghana_Highrisk_Flood_Surface_Area.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;) For Mac: Floodrisk_data &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;/Users/accountName/Desktop/GEOG0114/Workshop/Day 1/Ghana_Highrisk_Flood_Surface_Area.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;) I do not recommend doing it this way. Just set the work directory with the function setwd() to make life easier for yourself. Important Notes: The arguments used in read.csv() function – 1.) ‘file =’ is a mandatory option where you quote the name of the file you want to be imported; 2.) ‘header = TRUE’ option is set to TRUE which is telling RStudio that the file that is about to be imported has column names on the first row so it should NOT treat that first row as observations; and 3.) ‘sep = \",\"’ we are telling RStudio that the format of the dataset is comma separated. We have imported the flood high risk land surface coverage data. Now, let us import the second data for the total land surface area using the read.csv() function and call it landsurface_data. The code would look something as follows: # Import data using read.csv() function landsurface_data &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;Ghana_Total_Land_Surface_Area.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;) # Show viewer the data sets View(landsurface_data) View(Floodrisk_data) 2.2.4.2 Joining two datasets by merger using the merge() function You will often find yourself merging two or more data frames together, especially bringing together a spatial object with a non-spatial object. We cannot stress the importance of merging objects in the correct order so that the spatial attributes are aligned and preserved. In this instance, we are just dealing with two ordinary dataset which are non-spatial - i.e., one data set contains information on flood prone areas for geographic units in Ghana (i.e., districts), while the other contains its corresponding information for its total surface. Hence, it is possible to merge the two data frames uniquely using a common key variable like NAME_2. This task can be done using the merge function merge(). Consequently, we want the format of the merge code to look something akin to this syntax merge(target_object, selected_object, by=”COMMON_COLUMN”). Merging data frames is indeed a very important technique to know especially if you need to bring together event information with no spatial dimension with actual spatial data. Alright, let’s merge the total surface area data to the flood prone records using the NAME_2 column, and generate a bigger data frame that contains both these information: # Using the merge() function Full_data &lt;- merge(Floodrisk_data, landsurface_data, by.x = “NAME_2”, by.y = “NAME_2”, all.x = TRUE) # View the datasets View(Full_data) Important Notes: The arguments used in merge.csv(): Floodrisk_data is the target data frame we want something to be merged on to. landsurface_data is the selected data frame we are using to merge with the Fire_data. by.x = “NAME_2” option we are specifying the name of the join column from the target data frame i.e., Floodrisk_data. by.y = “NAME_2” option we are specifying the name of the join column from the selected data frame i.e., landsurface_data all.x=TRUE option we are telling RStudio to retain all rows that are originally from the target data after merging regardless of whether or not they are present in the selected data frame. So even if a row from the selected data does not find a unique link with any of the rows in the target data to match too - it will still preserve the target data frame by not discarding unlinked rows. But it will discard the unmatched rows from the selected data frame. We now have the necessary information together. Let’s quickly calculate the proportion of land surface affected by floods across the districts and save the results in a new file. # calculate the proportion of land surface area affected by floods Full_data$FLOOD_PRONE_PREV &lt;- (Full_data$FLOOD_PRONE/Full_data$SURFACE_AREA) 2.2.4.3 Saving your dataset using the write.csv() function Let us save a version of this as a .csv file as a saved product named “Ghana_Flood_TotalSurface_Data.csv”. This can be done by using the write.csv() function. It will export the data frame object into a .csv format. # Export ‘Full_data’ object as .csv into &#39;Day 1&#39; folder write.csv(Full_data, file = &quot;Ghana_Flood_TotalSurface_Data.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) Important Notes: The arguments used in merge.csv(): Full_data is an object we are exporting. It is compulsory to specify the object data frame we want to export file = is a mandatory argument. We must give a name to the file we wish to export it as with .csv extension. row.names = this is an annoying argument! It will automatically index the dataset with unique row numbers by default if we do not specify FALSE! Since the data has its own unique identifiers (i.e., NAME_2) we specify ‘FALSE’ to not perform this action of indexing The next section, we will create our first map to display the spatial distribution of proportion of land surface areas that are flood prone using the Full_data data frame object. 2.3 Basic visualisation of spatial data in RStudio 2.3.1 Installing packages into RStudio So far, we have been using functions and commands that are by default built-in RStudio. As you will become more and more proficient in RStudio, you will come to realise that there are several functions in RStudio that are in fact not built-in by default which will require external installation. For instance, the “sf” package which is called “Simply Features” allows the user to load shapefiles (a type of Vector spatial data) into RStudio’s memory. Another important package is called “tmap”, this package gives access to various functions that allows the user to write code and emulate RStudio as a GIS software. These are examples of packages with enables mapping of spatial data. They need to be installed as they not built-in programs in RStudio. For basic mapping, We will need to install following packages: tmap and sf using the install.packages(), and then activate the packages to make them active using the library() function. # install the two packages install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tmap&quot;) Once the installation is complete, you MUST activate the packages using the library() function. Type the following to perform this action: # Active the “sf” and “tmap” packages library(&quot;sf&quot;) library(&quot;tmap&quot;) 2.3.2 Adding shapefiles in RStudio The sf package grants the user access to a function called read_sf() to read-in shapefiles into RStudio. A shapefile typically contains the geometry of the spatial features e.g., points, line segment and boundaries of an areal feature etc. The shapefile has the extension of .shp (and are always accompanied by its other supporting files with extensions .shx, .prj, .dbf and .cpg). We have two types of shapefiles: District.shp which contains the spatial boundaries of all 260 districts in Ghana. Regions.shp which contains the spatial boundaries for all 16 regions in Ghana. We can easily load them in RStudio as Spatial Polygon objects by using the st_read(), type into your script: # Add shapefiles for districts and regions districts &lt;- st_read(&quot;Districts.shp&quot;) regions &lt;- st_read(&quot;Regions.shp&quot;) We interested in visualising the data at a district-level. We would need to merge the non-spatial (aka ordinary) data i.e., Full_data, uniquely in to the Spatial Polygon object we loaded in previously i.e., districts object, using the NAME_2 column. Again, we can use the merge() function to perform this task the same way we carried out the joining of the two ordinary data frames in section 2.2.4. Consequently, we want the format of the merge code to look something akin to this syntax merge(target_spatial_object, selected_non_spatial_object, by=”common_area_name”). # Using the merge() function Spatial_data &lt;- merge(districts, Full_data, by.x = “NAME_2”, by.y = “NAME_2”, all.x = TRUE) # View the datasets View(Spatial_data) 2.3.3 Mapping with ‘tmap’ functions in RStudio The tmap is the best package for creating maps in RStudio – it’s easy to code and user friendly. Let’s finally start some mapping! Here are some basic ‘tmap’ functions to be very familiar with: tmap functions What it does… tm_shape() This allows the user to add layers to the map tm_polygon() This allows the user to direct customisations the added layer specified in tm_shape(). Note: This follows immediately after tm_shape() tm_fill() Here, we specify the variable of interest we want to map in the boundaries specified in tm_shape() tm_layout() This allows the user to make heavy customisations to the main title, legends and other cosmetics to text sizes etc. tm_compass() This allows the user to add a compass visual to the map output tm_scale_bar() This allows the user to add a scale bar to the map output 2.3.3.1 Visualising the outline(s) of study area Suppose you want to visual just the outline of Ghana’s districts only: # Visual outline of London’s LSOA postcodes only tm_shape(Spatial_data) + tm_polygons() # Insert the “Spatial_data” object into the command line of # tm_shape(). No customisation has been applied here. You can customise the level of transparency for both the area and borders by adding some arguments in the tm_polygon() [i.e., alpha, and border.alpha which only take values between 0 (full transparency) to 1 (100% solid)]. For example: # Controlling transparencies for borders and areas tm_shape(Spatial_data) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1, border.alpha = 0.4) # Insert the “Spatial_data” object into the command line of # tm_shape(), and in tm_polygon(), make the background (alpha) 10% solid # and 40% for the borders (border.alpha) 2.3.3.2 Adding another layer on top of study area Suppose you want to add another layer to show the regions of Ghana for which the districts reside in, you can use another tm_shape() in the code, the coding would be as follows: # Adding another layer tm_shape(Spatial_data) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1, border.alpha = 0.4) + tm_shape(regions) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.alpha = 1, border.col = &quot;black&quot;) # The background of the added layer has been rendered to full # transparency with alpha set to 0 and borders are fully solid with # border.alpha set to 1 and border.col (colour) set to “black” to appear # pronounced. 2.3.3.3 Full visualising of data in the maps Suppose you want to visualise the spatial data for the flood burden, we can use the tm_fill() function. Let us visual the FLOOD_PRONE_PREV column which has CONTINUOUS values classed from 0 to 1 to signify areas that are affected (with 1 being the highest burden and 0 as vice versa). The coding would be as follows: # Generate map flood areas tm_shape(Spatial_data) + tm_fill(&quot;FLOOD_PRONE_PREV&quot;, style = &quot;cont&quot;, title = &quot;Flood prone areas (%)&quot;, palette = &quot;-RdYlGn&quot;) + tm_shape(districts) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.alpha = 1, border.col = &quot;black&quot;) + tm_scale_bar(position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) + tm_compass(type = &quot;arrow&quot;, position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot;)) + tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, legend.title.size = 0.8, legend.text.size = 0.7, legend.title.fontface = 2) In the tm_fill(), we insert the variable of interest we want to visual. The style argument tells RStudio how to break the values into intervals for the legend and colour scheme (there are many e.g., “fixed”, “cont”, “pretty” and “cat” etc.,). We used the “cat” in the style argument because the IMD_Decile variable is categorical. The title argument applies it to the legend only (not the plot itself!). The palette argument controls the colour scheme of the legend. In this example, we used a spectral type of colour i.e., “RdYlGn” that starts from Red (to show intense poverty) to Yellow (to signify normal) and to Green (to show intense levels of being rich). Geography 101 – when creating a map, it is always best to add the North compass and scale bar. This is done with the tm_compass() and tm_scale_bar() functions. The tm_layout() allows you to make further customisations to the map such as placing the legends outside the plot region and modifying the text size etc. You can experiment with them by checking the help menu – just type: ?tm_layout() in the console. Full map that is informative with details of the regional names would look something like: # final map for flood areas tm_shape(Spatial_data) + tm_fill(&quot;FLOOD_PRONE_PREV&quot;, style = &quot;cont&quot;, title = &quot;Flood prone areas (%)&quot;, palette = &quot;-RdYlGn&quot;) + tm_shape(districts) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.alpha = 1, border.col = &quot;grey&quot;) + tm_shape(regions) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = &quot;black&quot;) + tm_text(&quot;NAME_1&quot;, size = &quot;AREA&quot;, col = &quot;black&quot;) + tm_scale_bar(position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) + tm_compass(type = &quot;arrow&quot;, position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot;)) + tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, legend.title.size = 0.8, legend.text.size = 0.7, legend.title.fontface = 2) This concludes this session.
